# Basic Computer Processor

As part of the "CSEN 601: Computer System Architecture" course. We have implemented a basic computer processor with simple GUI to show the inputs and outputs. All done using Java.
### The project idea is as follows:


This is an implementation of the ***Spicy Von Neumann Fillet with extra shifts*** computer architecture.

**Components:**
* A memory 
    * Instruction memory
    * Data memory
* Registers
    * 30 general-purpose registers
    * Program Counter Register
    * Zero Register (R0)
*  Datapath Stages
    * Fetch Instruction
    * Decode Instruction
    * Execute
    * Memory Access
    * Write Back

**Algorithm:**
The program reads a text file that has some assembly code lines.
It interprets each line and converts it to some zeros and ones and adds them to the instruction memory
The program then starts fetching these instructions, decodes and executes them according to the datapath and pipeline.
